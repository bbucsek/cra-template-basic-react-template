## This is a Create React App Template with Redux toolkit, React router and Styled components

This template was created to make it easier to create a new react typescript app with all the necessary boilerplate code.
This template was set up with:
- redux, redux toolkit, redux thunk
- styled components with a theme object
- react router dom 

Original Create React App README available [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/cra-template-typescript/template/README.md)

# Usage

`npx create-react-app your-project-name --template react-basic`

or yarn

`yarn create react-app your-project-name --template react-basic`

# Motivation

We all know the struggle of starting a new project. Install all the necessary package, delete the unnecessary files/lines, set up the route and the theme... Thats why I create this template, to make it much quicker to start a new react project. 

# Available Scripts

- `npm start` - runs the app in developement mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to check it in the browser
- `npm test` - launch the test runner
- `npm build` - builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm eject` - exposes content of react-script package.

# Source

I use [this article by Alexander Grischuk](https://dev.to/alexandrg/how-to-create-custom-create-react-app-cra-templates-3nca ) to create this tempalte.
